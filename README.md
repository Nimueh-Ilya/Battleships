# Battleships Project to get used to JEST testing

The purpose of this project is to use Jest to test everything I want to test instead of console.log

So far because the project's methods are not tightly coupled (I think I still am unsure, im probably wrong as I am using functions instead of returning values?) there hasnt been much value in using jest.

ALSO first time using typescript so far so good I really enjoy writing the type of every small variable and object, yes it adds control but its a bit tedious.

Resuming programming after a break feels refreshing :D
